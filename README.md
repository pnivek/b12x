# b12x

`b12x` is an SM120-only CuTe DSL kernel library for Blackwell NVFP4 dense GEMM,
routed Mixture-of-Experts, and paged attention inference.

It is intentionally narrow. This is not a generic CUDA kernel collection or a
full model-serving stack. It does not intend to target any other GPU architectures,
including SM100. It is a focused package for a small number of hand-tuned, high-performance
SM120 kernels plus the runtime glue needed to launch them cleanly from PyTorch and `sglang`.

## Installation

### Runtime install

```bash
python -m pip install b12x
```

### Development install from source

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd b12x
python -m pip install -e '.[dev]'
```

## Requirements

- Blackwell SM120 GPU
- CUDA 13 toolchain
- Python `>=3.10,<4.0`
- CUDA 13 PyTorch, `torch>=2.10.0`
- `nvidia-cutlass-dsl[cu13]==4.4.1`
- FlashInfer available if you want reference and benchmark comparisons, but it's not a runtime dependency
- Qwen3.5-397B A17B NVFP4 checkpoint available through `B12X_MODEL_PATH` for the end-to-end MoE benchmark

## Package layout

- `b12x.attention`
  - SM120 paged attention forward kernel (TMA-based KV, FP8 KV cache, split-KV)
- `b12x.cute`
  - Low-level CuTe and FP4 helpers
- `b12x.gemm`
  - Standalone dense NVFP4 GEMM
- `b12x.integration`
  - Public runtime entrypoints: `b12x_moe_fp4`, `b12x_paged_attention_forward`, `create_paged_attention_plan`
- `b12x.moe.fused`
  - Static, micro, and dynamic fused MoE kernels and reference paths
- `b12x.quant`
  - Torch-side NVFP4 packing and quantization helpers
- `b12x.sglang`
  - Thin `sglang` integration shims

## Attention runtime contract (experimental)

**The attention kernel is a work in progress.** It is functional and passes correctness
tests but has not been tuned to the same degree as the MoE kernels.

- `b12x.integration.attention.create_paged_attention_plan` builds an exact-shape launch plan for one paged attention configuration.
- `allocate_paged_attention_workspace_for_plan` allocates reusable scratch buffers for a plan.
- `allocate_paged_attention_workspace_pool` provides a caller-owned pool that partitions scratch by CUDA stream for variable-shape workloads.
- `b12x_paged_attention_forward` executes the kernel given a plan and workspace.
- Page size is fixed at 64.
- Supported KV dtypes: BF16, FP16, FP8 E4M3.
- FP8 KV uses TMA loads with in-kernel BF16 dequant. Per-head descale tensors are optional.
- Split-KV is automatic outside CUDA graph capture; inside capture, `num_splits` must be explicit.
- GQA with arbitrary ratios is supported. When `tile_m % qhead_per_kvhead != 0`, Q loads fall back from TMA to per-thread async copies automatically.
- During CUDA graph capture, `output=` must be caller-owned and stable across replays.

## MoE runtime contract

- `b12x.integration.tp_moe.b12x_moe_fp4` requires a caller-owned workspace.
- `b12x` selects its fused MoE backend from shape alone:
  - compact routed workloads use the static or micro backend
  - all larger routed workloads use dynamic
- Use `allocate_tp_moe_workspace(...)` for one exact unchunked launch shape.
- Use `allocate_tp_moe_workspace_pool()` for variable-size or chunked workloads.
- Keep one workspace pool per process/device, and let the pool partition scratch by CUDA stream internally.
- During CUDA graph capture, `output=` must also be caller-owned and stable across replays.
